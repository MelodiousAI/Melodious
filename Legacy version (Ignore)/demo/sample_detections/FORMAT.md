# Detector Output Contract

This folder defines the exact detector payload expected by the graph/GNN integration code.

## Canonical JSON Shape

```json
{
  "image_path": "dataset_ds2_dense/images/example.png",
  "image_size": {
    "width": 2480,

  "model": {

      "confidence": 0.8712,
      "bbox": {

      },
      "bbox_pixels": {
        "x1": 847.0,

      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Contract Rules

- Bounding boxes for integration are center-based and normalized to `[0, 1]`.
- Pixel boxes are included as `bbox_pixels` for debugging and alignment checks.
- The confidence field name is always `confidence`.
- Class IDs must match `class_mapping.json` in this folder.
- One JSON file should correspond to one page image.

## Current Status

- Schema is frozen.
- 5 real detector outputs in `sample_detections/model_outputs_quick/` from YOLOv8s best.pt (mAP50=0.584).
- 5 ground-truth reference outputs in `sample_detections/reference/`.
